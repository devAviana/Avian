# he4o System

#### he4o is a Spiral Entropy Reduction Machine, a general-purpose Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system:

1. **Machine Learning Support**:
   - Primarily transfer learning
   - Reinforcement learning as a supplement
2. **Knowledge Representation (Macro & Micro Support)**:
   - Sparse coding
   - Features
   - Concepts
   - Time-series
   - Value
3. **Neural Network Support**: Dynamic, fuzzy, abstract-concrete, grouping and splitting, sensibility-based.
4. **Autonomous Lifelong Dynamic Learning for Agents**: Supports agents learning dynamically over their lifetime.
5. **Design Philosophy**: Both macro frameworks and micro details follow relative and cyclical transformations.
6. **Cognitive Control Support**:
   - Input & Output (Behavior & Perception) // with feedback
   - Cognition (Recognition & Learning) // with analogy
   - Needs (Tasks & Planning) // with intent
   - Decision-making (Solving & Transferring) // with analysis
7. **Mathematical Foundations**:
   - Set theory (for transfer)
   - Probability theory (for reinforcement)
8. **Computation**: Uses the simplest Boolean operations: `analogy` and `evaluation`.
9. **Memory Structure**: Long-term as networks (heuristic), short-term as trees (recursive), instant as sequences (sequential).
10. **Programming Philosophy**: DOP (Dynamic-Oriented Programming: Knowledge evolves from experience; inherent design only for controllers and storage structures).
11. **Performance Requirements**: Can run on a single machine (currently supports iOS devices).

### 1. -------------Introduction-------------

> **First Wave**: In 1950, Turing proposed the "thinking machine" and the "Turing Test," stating, "In the not-so-distant future, there is much work to be done."

> **Second Wave**: After the Dartmouth conference in 1956, pioneers like Minsky and McCarthy dedicated their lives to artificial intelligence. Although symbolic AI struggled with uncertainty, it laid the foundation for AGI.

> **Third Wave**: With the rise of big data and cloud computing, AI entered the era of Deep Learning (DL) and GPT. However, DL and GPT are still not fully functional intelligent agents.

> In conclusion: Over the past 70 years, AI research has had its ups and downs, but it remains far from the original vision of AI. he4o aims to realize a general-purpose AI system based on the Spiral Entropy Reduction Machine model.

### 2. -------------Spiral Theory-------------

> **Spiral Theory** officially began in February 2017 and matured by February 2018, after a year of development.

| Spiral Theory: It consists of three main elements: definition, relativity, and cycles, all presented in a spiral form. |


---

### 3. -------------Spiral Entropy Reduction Machine Model-------------

> The theoretical model of the Spiral Entropy Reduction Machine matured in March 2018 and continues to be refined today.

| 1. The diagram interprets the transformation in three ways: internal and external, dynamic and static, subject and object. |
| 2. Each outer module is relatively cyclic with all inner modules (e.g., neural networks with cognition, agents with the real world). |
| Note: Everything evolves from nothing, relative and cyclical, he4o believes that its existence stems from cycles. |

### 4. -------------he4o System Practice-------------

> **V1.0 "Initial Version"**:  
> Project started in February 2017 – Official release of V1.0 on October 21, 2018.  
> **V2.0 "Bird Survival Demo"**:  
> Completed in November 2018 – ongoing development and testing.

| Architecture Diagram | ![](https://s13.gifyu.com/images/SXUnH.png) |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture Design | Developed from Spiral Theory to the Spiral Entropy Reduction Machine model, and then to system architecture. |
| Code Distribution | Neural network: 30%, Cognitive controller: 50%, Other (input/output, etc.): 20%. |
| Neural Network Model Summary | Horizontal (macro & micro) and vertical (abstract-concrete). |
| Cognitive Directionality | Each operational direction represents a cognitive function such as recognition, decision-making, rationality, and sensibility. |
| Cognitive Modules | `1 to 2 to 4 to 8`: Perception (input), Recognition (cognition), Learning (knowledge), Task (need), Planning (goal), Solving (decision), Transferring (strategy), Action (output). |
| Cognitive Architecture | The overall cognitive controller operates in a spiral form. |

### 5. -------------Demo Demonstrations-------------

| 1 | Multi-directional Flight & Eating |
| --- | --- |
| Description | In this demo, the agent learns through interaction that eating nuts solves hunger and flying solves distance. After throwing the nuts, it will fly to eat them. |
| Operation | I fed two nuts and simulated hunger, the rest is the agent’s behavior. |

| 2 | Safety First |
| --- | --- |
| Description | In this demo, after a collision, the agent learns to avoid flying under the wooden stick to stay safe, even refusing to eat the nuts if they are below the stick. |
| Operation | I can double-click to drag it down, but it immediately avoids upward; I can feed the nuts manually, but it still avoids them. |

| 3 | Directional Food Search |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The agent attempts to fly to the nuts and eat them but initially misses them, then flies closer to successfully eat the nuts. |
| Operation | I threw the nuts, simulated hunger, and the rest is the agent's own thought and actions. |

| 4 | Dodge Then Eat |
| --- | --- |
| Description | After becoming hungry, the agent tries to eat but sees the wooden stick and dodges to safety before eating the nuts. |
| Operation | I threw the nuts and simulated hunger, threw the wooden stick, and the rest is the agent’s behavior. |
|  | ![](https://s7.gifyu.com/images/SXUnu.gif) |

| 5 | Initial Use of Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The agent kicks the nut with skin to the road, waits for the stick to crush it, and then eats it. |
| Operation | I threw the nuts with skin, simulated hunger, and threw the wooden stick, the rest is the agent’s action. |

### 6. -------------Payment Statement-------------

Payment: This software is a paid product, divided into two parts: usage payment and commercial payment:
1. Usage payment = the cost of one lunch per year for the user on average.  
   If the user’s income is below the average income of the local city or region, no payment is required.
2. Commercial payment = 0.1% of the commercial revenue generated by the software.  
   If

 a commercial user refuses to pay, the software will lock all functionality until payment is made.
